Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh my God, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

<TITLE>Ten Thousand Hours</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
I hope that God decides to talk through him
That the people decide to walk with him
Regardless of Pitchfork, cosigns I've jumped
Make sure the soundman doesn't cockblock the drums
Let the snare knock the air right outta your lungs
And those words be the oxygen
Just breathe
Amen, regardless I'ma say it
Felt like I got signed the day that I got an agent
Got an iTunes check, shit man I'm paying rent
'Bout damn time that I got out of my basement
'Bout damn time I got around the country and I hit these stages
I was made to slay them
Ten thousand hours
I'm so damn close I can taste it
On some Malcolm Gladwell
David-Bowie-meets-Kanye shit
This is dedication
A life lived for art is never a life wasted
Ten thousand

[Hook]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 2]
Now, now, now
This is my world, this is my arena
The TV told me something different I didn't believe it
I stand here in front of you today, all because of an idea
I could be who I wanted if I could see my potential
And I know that one day I'ma be him
Put the gloves on, sparring with my ego
Everyone's greatest obstacle, I beat him
Celebrate that achievement
Got some attachments, some baggage, I'm actually working on leaving, see
I observed Escher
I love Basquiat
I watched Keith Haring
You see I study art
The greats weren't great because at birth they could paint
The greats were great because they'd paint a lot
I will not be a statistic, just let me be
No Child Left Behind, that's the American scheme
I make my living off of words
And do what I love for work
And got around 980 on my SATs
Take that system
What you expect?
Generation of kids choosing love over a desk
Put those hours in, and look at what you get
Nothing that you can hold, but everything that it is
Ten thousand

[Hook]
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me
Ten thousand hours felt like ten thousand hands
Ten thousand hands, they carry me

[Verse 3]
Same shit, different day, same struggle
Slow motion as time slips through my knuckles
Nothing beautiful about it
No light at the tunnel
For the people that put the passion before them being comfortable
Raw, unmedicated heart, no substitute
Banging on table tops, no subs to toot
I'm feeling better than ever, man what is up with you?
Scraping my knuckles, I'm battling with some drug abuse
I lost another friend, got another call from a sister
And I speak for the people that share that struggle too
Like they got something bruised
My only rehabilitation was the sweat, tears and blood when up in the booth

[Bridge]
It's the part of the show where it all fades away
When the lights go to black and the band leaves the stage
And you wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave
Part of the show, it all fades away
Lights go to black, band leaves the stage
You wanted a encore but there's no encore today
'Cause the moment is now, can't get it back from the grave

[Outro]
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist
Welcome to the Heist

[Intro]
Cover me, oh!

[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me

[Verse]
Spirits in my room, friend or foe?
Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
Dusting off my jumpsuit (Cover me)

[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate (Cover me, oh)
Pressures of a new place roll my way (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me (Cover me, oh)

[Bridge]
I'll be right there
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone
I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)
But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)

I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way

<TITLE>Bad Guy</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, Let it go, fuck this.
Heart's saying, I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 2]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)

[Verse 3]
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner

[Verse 4]
I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off

<TITLE>Eraser</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Verse 2]
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

[Chorus]
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

[Bridge]
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

[Chorus]
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

<BODY>
The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, it's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come see break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?

Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down till the breaking up

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything that we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this breaking up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I'm trying not to break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

[Intro: Macklemore]
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you, come on, let's go
Yeah! Let's go!
Alright, alright, okay
Alright, okay
Alright, okay

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said…

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up

Oh, oh, oh, oh…

<TITLE>Levitate</TITLE>
<BODY>
Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

[Bridge]
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

[Verse]
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help

<TITLE>Castle on the Hill</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

<BODY>
Our secret moments
In a crowded room
They've got no idea
About me and you
There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Made your mark on me
A golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

[chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't like you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off

[2]
Inescapable
I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about

All of this silence and patience, pining, and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

[chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't like you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off

[bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut, and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times
You could see the best of me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst light
You saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake and I can't explain this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't like you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off

There is an indentation
In the shape of you

Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada doo da
What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada doo da

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin'
Lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now, walk into the club, like, What up, I got a big cock!
Nah, I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey!
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink; except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
(Pissssss...) But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it
'Bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins
Someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stunting and flossin' and saving my money
And I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch!
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, Ah, he got the Velcros.

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin'
Lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin'
Lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin'
I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt, 'cause right now, I'm up in hurr stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight
I'm like, Yo, that's 50 dollars for a t-shirt.
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

[Interlude]
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin'
Lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Bridge: Wanz]
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)
I look incredible (now come on, man)
I’m in this big-ass coat (big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (let's go, come on!)

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that if and when are truly different cries
For if is purely panic and when is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For above is blind belief and under is sword to sleeve
And around is scientific miracle, let's pick above and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For above is blind belief and under is sword to sleeve
And around is scientific miracle, let's pick above and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else

If I keep moving, they won't know

[Intro]
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one

[Verse 1]
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan.
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard.
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch

[Hook]
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge]
(Now, what's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don’t know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha
(Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)

[Verse 2]
No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens to be rappin', blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip-hop is the Devil's music)
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—

[Hook]
It's the time of the season
When hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

[Bridge]
(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?)

[Verse 3]
So yeah, Dad, let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I a-ppealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads!
The sign of my hustle says:
Don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute!
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion until I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a Criminal!
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald!
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: Dad, I'm back at it again!

[Outro]
Yeah… (Who's your daddy?)

Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Don't jock, don't jock baby, don't jock me
I drop the hotness, baby watch me
You can't, you can't, no you can't stop me
Cause I'm a champ on the rap like Rocky
And when I spit it, tri not a Z rocks me
Cause my styles trademark with the copy - right?
You know my style is naughty - right? So don't cock-block me!
You like my style when I'm wiling out with my gang
And I gain my fame from doing my damn thing - on the mic
Then I burn the stage like propane
And I bang them thangs, I'm a lover mayne

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We came here to turn you out
Everybody in the place get wild
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We bout to drop it on your ass right now
Everybody in the place get wild (so what you saying?!)

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Our style lined up when we team up
JT and BEP sold the scene up
Cali to Tennessee and in between em
We the hottest in the biz, turn the beat up!
We be rolling four Hummers and a Beemer
When sun set, up the cheap cantina
Stepped out looking fresh and clean-ah
Paparazzi put me in they magazine-ah
I got eight million ways to rock ya like this
And ain't nobody drop their styles like this
I'm a give it to you like that and like this
And my momma always told me My baby's a genius

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We came here to turn you out
Everybody in the place get wild
I know that you like my style, I know that you like my style
We bout to drop it on your ass right now
Everybody in the place get wild (so what you saying?!)

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Te gusta me estilo, dile a tu tia y tu tio
Aye viene Jimmy wit the lingo (lingo) I like to keep my style on single (single)
Baby you can call me mijo (mijo) I make you say Aye Dios mio! (mio)
Tu chocha es todo mio (ayee) I make it hot for you if it's frío (frío)

[Breakdown: will.i.am]
It feels like something's heating up
Timbaland's on the drum-drum, he's beating up
Black Eyed Peas, there's no defeating us
JT, he's rocking the beat with us
Them freaks, they want to freak with us
After the spot they tryna to meet with us
They know our style is fabulous
We off the hook, our styles ridiculous

[Post-Chorus]
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu girl?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!
Wassup, wassup whichu boy?!

[Outro: Timbaland Justin Timberlake]

[intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I stroke a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
The shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[pre-chorus]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun, shot in the dark

[chorus]
You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh
No, we never get far, oh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
While he was running after us, I was screaming go, go, go!
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

[pre-chorus]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first old fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun, shot in the heart

[chorus]
You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoul've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh
No, we never get far, oh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in the bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

[chorus]
Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we never get far (don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh
No, we never get far, oh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[outro]
I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

Riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

<TITLE>Thin Line</TITLE>
<BODY>
Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Same city, yeah, we can’t break up
Nice mask on, I wore the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment – what’s the matter?
She’s learning that she never should have dated a rapper
I don’t blame her, my mind is gone
I’m at dinner, checking phone calls, texts and blogs
I don’t hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs
It goes on and on
Don’t wanna break you, but I’m leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it’s gone

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on, on and on, and on we go
And on, on and on, and on we go
We love what we had, but now it’s gone
Let’s leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Refrain: Buffalo Madonna]
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It’s over
Over

[Bridge: Buffalo Madonna]
Didn’t believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I’m on the homie’s couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can’t live without her
Now you’re paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain’t like you alone
Haven’t made love with the lights still on
It’s like you’re hiding something from me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Let’s fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy of me husband and you wife
Lyin’, staring into those two eyes
And I can’t take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let’s keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love – maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to God, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and gettin' my heart thawed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a sawed off shotgun at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with a complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I’ve been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I’m leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it’s so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

[Bridge: Macklemore & Buffalo Madonna]
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less
Can’t get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

[Hook: Buffalo Madonna]
And on on and on and on we go
And on on and on and on we go
Love what we had but now it's gone
Let's leave before we eat each other alive
Alive

[Refrain: Buffalo Madonna]
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You were the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over

When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall
I'll grab my light

[Refrain]
And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you

Surrounded and up against a wall

When choices end, you must defend
I'll grab my bat

And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you, yeah

Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

[Verse 3]
If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Did they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run

If you find yourself in a lion's den
I'll jump right in and pull my pin

And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you

I'll go with you, I'll go with you

<TITLE>So Much Better</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro]
You fuckin' groupie!
Pick up the goddamn phone!

[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch, what'd you do? Screw Dre?
You went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You want to lose two legs?
You tryin' to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?, well, screw you
And I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—oohm, touché
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one true-blue ace, but you ain't
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late; go smurf yourself!
You make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much better

[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over
But they let me go, 'cause I told 'em I'm only drivin' drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on
'Cause a woman broke my he-art
I say he-art 'cause she ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage; who do you think you a-are?
Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo… Lesbian! Aaahhh!
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life'd be so much better if you just—

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead?
I would feel so much better

[Bridge]
'Cause you told me
You'd love me forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never wanted someone
To die so bad in my fuckin' life
But fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
And I'ma have a whale of a time, bein' a single sailor
For the night, bitch, on a scale of
One to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of
Catches, ho, I got an Oscar
Attached to my fuckin' name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-
Made for me, say fuck it
Kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin'
To latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boy's
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes

[Chorus]
My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And this thought just popped in my head (you made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit
Just be a lot easier if you dropped dead? (bitch)
I would feel so much better

[Outro]
I'm just playin', bitch
You know I love you

<TITLE>Shape of You</TITLE>
<BODY>
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

[Intro: will.i.am & Fergie]
Yeah, uh-uh
La, da, da, da, da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I been tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after what you did, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forgedmy signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

[Hook: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie ('cause)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you and what you all are about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
She said I'm leavin'
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

[Pre-Hook 2: Fergie, will.i.am (& apl.de.ap)]
Oh, when I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
(And now our emotions are drained)
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

[Hook 2: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (no, don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try (got to, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (what you gonna do, baby?)
When I really see you and what you all are about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try

[Bridge: will.i.am (& Fergie)]
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it

[Pre-Hook 3: Fergie & Taboo, Both]
Oh, when I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
Till there's not turning back
I don't know why and I lie and I lie
Till I don't know who I am
Let me tell myself

[Hook 3: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try (you know, you know you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you and what you all are about?

I never trust a narcissist
But they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them
They tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy
But they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin'
What I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one

Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good? (good)
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could

So bad, why's it feel so good?

<TITLE>Same Love</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, Yeah, I'm good at little league.
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And God loves all his children is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
Man, that's gay gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
Gay is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient
Love is kind

<TITLE>Chlorine</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro: Paul Meany]
So, where are ya? It's been a little while

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Verse 1]
Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations, woah
Help my body run

[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Verse 2]
Fall out of formation, woah
I plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh
Grows while I decay

[Refrain]
I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life
Runnin' for my life

[Verse 3]
Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like

[Chorus]
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave, don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

[Interlude]
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah

[Outro]
I'm so sorry I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical

<TITLE>Survival</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin' raps
And standin' for somethin': fuckin' acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what will happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon
Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers
Nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, ‘cause—

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank
Maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck!
But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow
I'm stabbin' myself with a fuckin' knife in the gut
While I'm wipin' my butt
‘Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood
You're in a fight with a nut
‘Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
Now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do: as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue
I'm showin' you the flow no one do
‘Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
‘Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
‘Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, ‘cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, ‘cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

<TITLE>Perfect</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
Or chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days

[Verse 1]
Now, this is my job, I will not quit it
Pulled me out the depths when I thought that I was finished
Yeah I questioned if I could go the distance
That's just the work, regardless of who's listening, listening
Listen, see I was meant to be a warrior
Fight something amongst me, leave here victorious
Classroom of kids, or a venue performing
If I'd done it for the money I'd have been a fucking lawyer
Concrete, vagabond, van telling stories
Humbled by the road, I'm realizing I'm not important
See life's a beautiful struggle, I record it
Hope it helps you maneuvering through yours and
That's why we stay in the lab at night
I've been staring into this pad for over half my life
A true artist won't be satisfied
So I guess that's the sacrifice
And I say

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

[Verse 2]
Forget about the fame, fortune and the mansion
Sitting and tripping watching myself on a plasma
Yeah, I start slipping when I'm thinking about that stuff
Ego once swollen until karma catches that up, that up
I'm my grandma's number one grandson
I lost myself to remember who that was
We start thinking about some kicks, necklace
What I really need is a job off CraigsList
Take away the dot com, name, love
Fans, Twitter followers, and the buzz
See, you keep the issues but you take away the drugs
And I had to find out who I really was
Who I really wasn't
So sick of who I was becoming
Yeah, tired of running
Time to look at the man in the mirror until I can learn to love him

[Hook]
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true, I say
Make the money, don't let the money make you
Change the game, don't let the game change you
I'll forever remain faithful
All my people stay true

[Bridge]
Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'lac
Watch the videos and get the girls in the back
But if that's what I believe in, and the reason that I rap
Uncle Sam is my pimp when he puts me on the track
Of course I want dubs and a candy-painted 'lac

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go
Tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say
No matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him

[Pre-Hook: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words

[Hook: Polina]
‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, That's right, fight's on, bitch!
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

[Hook: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—

[Hook: Polina]
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee
It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

<TITLE>Galway Girl</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, Baby, I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Intro: Q-Tip]
Wow, we in stereo?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Question for the ages
What's going on with my rap pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm, come on
It's the Abstract, Will is on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in there for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it, be marvelled of the speakers please
'Cause they gonna rumble and shake the ground
Break atoms, break a sound
Thunder and bass full pound
Streets with the things profound
If you wanna do to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it can help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a...

[Hook: will.i.am & (Cee-Lo Green)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Barstow
You know I'm known to cook a nigga like charcoal
Steady jumpin' round like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tonto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
Kobe showed the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we Wells Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke herbs but I'm still real nice with the verbs
So [Fuck] (Hey!) what you heard
'Cause we got it like that

[Hook: will.i.am & (Cee-Lo Green)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that
(Talib, just hit 'em like that)

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at Remy like Mike Rap like to yack is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this, Will, so I might get ill
On the mic somebody might get killed
So many dead rappers there's a cypher in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust, its the stuff of Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd o'cattle down Myrtle Avenue
Where we at ain't nothin pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the Sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like Sake
My lyrics get out a split atoms like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

[Verse 4: apl.de.ap]
It's the apl.de.ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making nah hot shish and be shocking them out
Tss tsss tsss, I'mma roll with the hot
I'mma flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'mma simply simply always attach
Jeepny music from by apl.de.ap
From L.A to Philippines we bridging the gap
We got it like that you know we got it like that
We got it like... like we got it like that y'all

[Hook: will.i.am & (Q-Tip)]
And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)
It's like that 'cause I got it like that

[Interlude: Q-Tip]
It's like that and a...

It's like that and a...
It's like that and a...

I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most
I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away, whenever you need me
I'm in a G5
Come to the A side
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like
You love it
I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ahh
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too
I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame

[Intro: Macklemore]
Uh-huh, um

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
1-2, now
'Round here they sing broken hymns
Their prayers flow better when they're soaked in gin
The amp's dusty and sits in the corner
By a bartender that’ll pickpocket your heart
And a jukebox that’ll steal your quarter
Bartender, please give me a confession
Exchange fear for courage in the form of a well drink
There’s a heavy current, got a long way to swim
Closed the Bible a while ago, I need some shots for this sin
Hail Mary, come with me, feel like Pac when it hits
Got some fire in my belly and a riot in the gut
Bushmills for a band-aid, the sweet taste of blood
Then I might actually feel something if I don’t cover it up
Rusted faces, familiar places
Even if they haven’t left the vinyl booth that they stayed in
The motel next door, a sign that reads vacant
And a truth that’s so strong I’d be a fool not to chase it
But yea, I’m a fool and I stay here
Hope these problems drown themselves, I die in wait here
One more, four more, fuck it, a night cap
Service starts at 5 tomorrow and I’ll be right back

[Hook: Allen Stone]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns is perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I read the Bible but I forgot the verses
The liquor store is open later than the church is
Pure by their imperfections, everything is burning
To hell with the confessions, all the Lord Have Mercys
Blessed in holy water, the sin, oh Holy Father
Have you ever smelled flesh that sweats out Monarch vodka?
11 AM in the morning and you can’t get it off ya
Calling to the preacher but it’s like the pastor isn’t talking
Until the store opens and I can re-up on that doctrine
The people close to me say that I’m in need of a doctor
Think that I got a problem but these are not apostles
This is the drink of the Lord, that’s according to my gospel
Open to interpretation, if you’re judging it I don’t want it
I got sins that scald like my throat when I hit the bottle
And I’m sinking and that’s why I keep on drinking
I need a refill, far more than once every weekend
Sweet Jesus, I’m getting amnesia
Shaking til I’d get a taste, my faith is having seizures
Every time I walk away and try to leave it
Every time I walk away and try to leave it

[Bridge: Macklemore]
Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God at the Neon Cathedral
Wouldn’t miss it for the world
Baptized in my vices and the bar is my church
Traded my artist and I pawned off the easel
Spend it all searching for God, Neon Cathedral
Neon Cathedral

[Hook: Allen Stone]
Underneath this fragile frame
Lives a battle between pride and shame
But I’ve misplaced that sense of pride
This crown of thorns perched atop my spine
But listen closely as I testify
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Outro: Allen Stone]
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night
Dependency has been a thief at night
Thief at night, thief at night

[Intro]
Call (Call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 1]
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 2]
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

[Bridge 1]
Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)

[Bridge 2]
'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking I'll teach them
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated

<TITLE>Asshole</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking: If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
‘Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Interlude: Eminem]
Thanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo!
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time
It ain't never gonna stop a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
So now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m going back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Outro]
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you

Bring on the rhythm; bring on the drums
The rim shot sound like someone gunned

So raise the volume to the maximum
Base booming bout to make your body feel numb
Pulsations probably penetrate your skeleton
This little diddley definitely demonstrates some
Dum diddley dum - so dance to the drum

Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound

Repeating rhy-rhythm in satisfaction
No need for asking, that's what's happening

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

<TITLE>The Hype</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Take me with you)

[Bridge]
(We’re gonna rely pretty heavily
On technology
And energy
To cover up the fact that we’re only two people
But I think we can do it)

No, I don't know which way I’m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I’m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

Nice to know my kind will be on my side

And you know you're a terrible sight

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, Stick it!
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!

[Scratch]

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say Fuck it! before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

<TITLE>New Man</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro]
Nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 1]
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Verse 2]
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says Chune, bwoydem light up the room!
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

[Outro]
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, She's gone too far this time

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

<TITLE>White Walls</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished
Q

[Chorus: Hollis]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright

What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no

No, no

[Intro]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.
But I'm only going to get this one chance.
Something's wrong, I can feel it.
Six minutes. Six minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.
You are just what the doc ordered.

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like have got. Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, till I walk a flock of flames
F a plank ain, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy
You're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay!—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a hell yeah from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs, I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on I'm Back from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream.
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop,—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice,Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still Chunky but Funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

<TITLE>What Do I Know?</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Verse 2]
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

[Chorus]
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, they ain’t giving it
I’m taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
If I just went in and stole it, the police would have noticed
Gotta be strategic, creep it, go in, leave without motive
Hold up, my plan is forming, alright, casing this building
Watch these rappers that rappin' walk in and leave out with millions (millions)
Headed in sweating, open that front door
Interscope printed out right by the entrance
Door closes, not a metaphor
Then I start towards that front desk, right where you check in
Dressed in a uniform, acting like a janitor
All blue, jumpsuit, rush in
Bloodthirsty for the money like a bull
Looking in the eyes of the matador (Fuck you!)
Carrying two cans of paint, security looks at me awkward
I say third floor I'm late, paintin' Jimmy Iovine's office
Holding my breath 'bout to faint
I’m scared to death that he stops me
Heart beating so loud that you can hear the echo in that lobby
And see I'm breaking down if I don’t make it out
Then I'm leaving town with that contract
And I'm spazzing out, grabbing the A&R out
His chair and I'm taking him hostage
I don't give a fuck, step into the elevator, press 3
Now I'm headed up (Heist!)
What they don't know is there is a gun in the paint can
And I’m ready and willing to bust 'em, I'm fucking desperate
Stuck in this recession, now what you think
If I could get signed my life is destined
My future depends on ink
And secretary at the front of the entrance staring right at me
I walk up she whispers Go ahead, and then gives me a wink

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
I put my life on the line
I roll them dice and I'm fine
Cause all I ever dreamt about was makin' it
They ain't giving it, I'm taking it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, they ain't giving it
I'm taking it, taking it, I need all that shit

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I made it past security, the secretary, the cubicles
But it’s weird, it’s like this room I’ve walked into is unusual
Thought it would be shiny and beautiful
Thought it would be alive and like musical
But it feels like someone died, it’s got the vibe of a funeral
There’s numbers on a chalkboard
CDs boxed in cardboard
Artists that flopped, that got dropped and never got to be sophomores
Graphic designers are sitting around
Waiting for albums that never come out
Complainin' that they have nobody in house
Wonderin’ what they make art for
I start thinking, am I in the right place?
Just walk forward, see plaques on the wall
Oh yeah, in a second those will be all yours
Finally see an office with a mounted sign, heaven-sent
Big, block, silver letters, read it out loud, President (Heist!)
This was my chance to grab that contract and turn and jet
Right then felt a cold hand grab on the back of my neck, he said

[Outro: Jimmy Iovine & Macklemore]
We’ve been watching you, so glad you could make it
Your music, it's so impressive, and this whole brand you created
You're one hell of a band, we here think you're destined for greatness
And with that right song we all know that you're next to be famous
Now I’m sorry, I’ve had a long day, remind me now what your name is?
That’s right, 'Macklemore,' of course... today has been crazy
Anyway, you ready? We’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars
After your album comes out, we’ll need back that money that you borrowed
So it’s really like a loan?
A loan?! Come on, no
We're a team, 360 degrees, we will reach your goals!
You'll get a third of the merch that you sell out on the road
Along with a third of the money you make when you’re out doing your shows
Manager gets twenty, booking agent gets ten
So shit, after taxes, you and Ryan have 7% to split!
That’s not bad, I’ve seen a lot worse
No one will give you a better offer than us
Mm-hm, I replied, I appreciate the offer
Thought that this is what I wanted
Rather be a starving artist
Than succeed at getting fucked

[Intro]
Or Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper Eminem
Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer. If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use, society would reap a great benefit.

[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches
With these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous
It's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch
This predicament's despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed
It's ridiculous, I look like a frickin' wuss
A pussy, this kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head, Momma always said—

[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished, they've stomped me
Into the mud, gee, for what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you
Beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin'
In a trance locked in my room
Yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket
I can't stop it, and I'm starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch – end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void
Been usin’ it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd there’s a Ford engine
Door hinge, syringe, an orange
An extension cord, and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin’ board, a bench, a wrench, an ORU
Winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain
But dome's off the fuckin' chain like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said—

[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Bridge]
Now my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile, gettin' stomped
But somehow I came out on top

[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, y'all, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out, Go!
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs
Freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out
In terror, they were so scared
And those kids just about belted out
Whatever spouted or fell out
Of my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate? So be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch-yeah
'Til then, hopefully you little homos
Get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight
They said I provoke queers 'til emotions evoke tears
My whole career's a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin'—insert insult here
Who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket, and still the shit got
That white-trash traffic in gridlock
Shit hoppin' like six blocks
From a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-
-tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
And get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all, 'cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said—

[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said
Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Guess it pays to be brainless

[Outro]
Insaneness ain't even a word, you stupid fuck!
Neither is ain't

<TITLE>How Would You Feel (Paean)</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Verse 2]
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

[Pre-Chorus]
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask

[Chorus]
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too

<TITLE>Gone Going</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1: Will.I.Am]
Johnny wanna be a big star
Get on stage and play the guitar
Make a little money, buy a fancy car
Big old house and an alligator
Just to match with them alligator shoes
He's a rich man so he's no longer singing the blues
He's singing songs about material things
And platinum rings and watches that go bling
But, diamonds don't bling in the dark
He a star now, but he ain't singing it from the heart
Sooner or later, he's just gonna fall apart
'Cause his fans can't relate to his new found art
He ain't doin' what he did from the start
And that's putting in some feeling and thought
He decided to live his life shallow
Cash in his love for material
And it's gone

[Hook: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Awkward with their things, gone

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
You see yourself in the mirror, and ya
You feel safe cause it's looks familiar, but 'cha
Afraid to open up your soul, cause ya
Don't really know, don't really know who is (who is)
The person that's deep within
Cause you content with just being the name brand man
And you fail to see that its trivial
Insignificant, you addicted to material
I seen your kind before
You the type that think souls is sold in the store
Packaged up with incense sticks
With them vegetarian meals, to you that's righteous
You're fiction like books
Need to go out to life and look
Cause what happens when they take your material
And you already sold your soul
And it's...

[Hook: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Awkward with their things, gone

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
They say that Time is money and money is time
So you got cha mind in your money and your money on your mind
But what about
That crime you did to get paid
And what about
That bid you can't take it too your grave
Tell me about it

[Bridge: Jack Johnson]
What about those shoes you in today they'll be no good
On the bridges you walk along the way

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
All that money chu got
Gonna be gone
That ear that chu rock
Gonna be gone
That house upon that hill
Gonna be gone
The gold burns on your grill
Gonna be gone
The ice on your wrist
Gonna be gone
That nice little Miss
Gonna be gone
That whip that chu roll
Gonna be gone
What's worse is your soul already gone
Yeah, it's gone

[Hook: Jack Johnson]
Gone going
Gone, everything gone-give a damn
Gone be the birds when they don't wanna sing
Gone people
Awkward with their things, gone
Gone...

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

<TITLE>Wings</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like
Momma, this air bubble
Right here, it's gonna make me fly
I hit that court, and when I jumped, I jumped
I swear I got so high
I touched the net
Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life
Air Maxes were next
That air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the thread
In school I was so cool
I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em
Four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro
Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right
Wanted to be him, I wanted to be that guy
I wanted to touch the rim, I wanted to be cool
And I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me Be a consumer
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid? Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

[Verse 1]
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

[Verse 2]
In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

[Bridge]
Folina, Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito (Sahlo)
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban—I'm a bandito

[Outro]
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina

<TITLE>Stronger Than I Was</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothin' without you, and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, Baby, please don't leave!
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease
You're just fucking with me, and you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

[Hook]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream Fuck you!
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
‘Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, Baby, please don't leave!
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothin', nothin' for me
So, please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

[Hook]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream Fuck you!
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all – fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay

[Bridge]
And I thank you, ‘cause you made me
A better person than I was
But I hate you, ‘cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone

[Hook]
But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream Fuck you!
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was

[Verse 1]
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, Don't you cry when you're down
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, Hallelujah, you're home

[Verse 2]
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

[Chorus]
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, Hallelujah, you're home

[Outro/Chorus]
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, Hallelujah, you're home

[Intro]
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom)

[Verse 1]
Hey y'all, John Coltrane yeah he plays the sax
Me, myself I love to max
Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax
And now I'm feeling fine
Cause daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day
So pass the peas like we used to say
Pass the beats like they used to say
Pass the phunk like they used to say
That's my joint like we used to say
Syncopation the true school way

I don't know what you came to do

Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?

Oo, lala aw wee wee
Nowadays music is all about fee
The soul is caged no bits now free
Unless the rhyme was rocked by me
I got the balls to bang (baw ba-ba-baw, ba-ba-baw, ba-baw bang)
Yeah, steady, just doing my thang (steady, just steady, just doing my own thang)
I just do it (ha!)
I just do it you know
My momma said to do what you know
So I'ma do what I know
James Brown gave me the fluid
That means a baby could do it
The Peas will do it so

[Pre-Hook]
Do it, do it, do it
Get up on the stage and release my fluid
Do my thing, do it through the music
Phunkafied and therapeutic

[Hook]
I don't know what you came to do
I came to drop the phunk on you
Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?
They don't want music

You've got to shake with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)
Shaking shaking shaking with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)

See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes…
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…

[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?

And all the pieces fall (Pieces fall)

Getting caught up in a moment (Caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face

Makes sense, 'cause fifteen-year-olds seem twenty
And twenty-five -year-olds seem ten
I used to drink away my paycheck
Celebrate the mistakes I hadn't made yet
Our generation isn't the best on safe sex
We forget the latex, becoming Planned Parenthood patients
Synthetic heroin is the new basehead
So much to escape, fuck a straight edge
Walk around looking through a fake lens
Apps this good, who's got time to make friends?
I wish I didn't care
If cynical hispters with long hair
And cocaine problems, like my music
It's not my issue, I can't solve it

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
They say, It's so refreshing to hear somebody on records
No guns, no drugs, no sex, just truth
The guns - that's America, the drugs are what they gave to us
And sex sells itself, don't judge 'til it's you
Ah, I'm not more or less conscious
Than rappers rapping 'bout them strippers up on a pole, popping
These interviews are obnoxious
Saying that It’s poetry, you’re so well spoken, stop it
I grew up during Reaganomics
When Ice T was out there on his killing cops shit
Or Rodney King was getting beat on
And they let off every single officer
And Los Angeles went and lost it
Now every month there's a new Rodney on YouTube
It's just something our generation is used to
And neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
Unless they're gentrifying, white people don't even cruise through
And my subconscious telling me stop it
This is an issue that you shouldn't get involved in
Don't even tweet R.I.P Trayvon Martin
Don't wanna be that white dude million-man marching
Fighting for a freedom that my people stole
Don't wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
But you don't even have a fuckin' song for radio
Why you out here talking race, trying to save the fucking globe?
Don't get involved if the cause isn't mine
White privilege, white guilt, at the same damn time
So we just party like it's 1999
Celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying

[Hook: Evan Roman]
My flight has finally landed down
And the ground has stopped moving all around
Eyes open, awake for the very first time
We both forfeit this game of crime

[Outro: Evan Roman]
I need love
You need love
Give me love
And I'll give you my love

<BODY>
[Verse 1]
I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Verse 2]
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Interlude]
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Bridge]
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Outro]
Pet cheetah, cheetah
Pet cheetah, cheetah

<TITLE>The Monster</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MC's, blood gets spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through
A struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head
(You're tryin' to) You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
(And you think) And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'

Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone
Unless you wanna come along

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon, yay
And these days, days days, they never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melted
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the pharaohs
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band-aid when you’re gone
Now I, now I-I-I, I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
Today we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Alright now, we open up
That car door, hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by stickin' out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight, we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun like

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t have
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Loungin' on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sippin' on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sippin' Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it...

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Intro]
I own a mansion but live in a house
A king-size bed but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew

[Verse 1]
This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john I get maddened
Shady, what up? What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue, yeah, hand me that
On second thought I'd be glad then
Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan.
I wiped my ass with it
Crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: Todd, you're the shit, when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causing an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass!
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past – iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm as stubborn as

[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Verse 2]
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I'd be doin' if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag – teenagers act more fuckin' mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me? I leave on my own terms, asshole
I'm goin' berzerk, my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catchin' up with me

[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Bridge]
Got friends on Facebook all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So, I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

[Verse 3]
I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!
I'm in the crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught picking my nose (agh!)
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, What you bumpin'?
Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better, fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit – what a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse – I'm livin' the dream!

[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on the city that made me
And (life's been good to me so far)

[Intro]
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 1]
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

[Verse 2]
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Someone told me, Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)
Wo nooma (be ye ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye (be ye ye)

[Chorus]
Someone told me, Always say what's on your mind
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma (be ye ye)

<TITLE>Union</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Verse 1]
We don't want war- can't take no more
It's drastic time for sure
We need an antidote and a cure
Cause do you really think Muhammad got a problem with Jehovah
We don't want war imagine if any prophet was alive
In current days amongst you and I
You think they'd view life like you and I do
Or would they sit and contemplate on why
Do we live this way, act and behave this way
We still live in primitive today
Cause the peace in the destination of war can't be the way
There's no way, so people just be a woman, be a man
Realize that you can change the world by changing yourself
And understand that we're all just the same
So when I count to three let's change

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Verse 2]
Got no time for grand philosophy
I barely keep my head above the tide
I got this mortgage, got three kids at school
What you're saying is the truth, but really troubles me inside
I'd change the world if I could change my mind
If I could live beyond my fears
Exchanging unity for all my insecurity
Exchanging laughter for my tears

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

[Verse 3]
I don't know, y'all, we in a real deposition
In the midst of all this negative condition
Divided by beliefs, differences and religion
Why do we keep missing the point in our mission?
Why do we keep killing each other, what's the reason?
God made us all equal in his vision
I wish that I could make music as a religion
Then we could harmonise together in this mission
Listen, I know it's really hard to make changes
But two of us could help rearrange this curse
Utilising all the power in our voices
Together we will unite and make the right choice
And fight for education, save the next generation
Come together as one
I don't understand why it's never been done
So let's change on the count of one

[Bridge]
It takes one, just one
And then one follows the other one
And then another follows the other one
Next thing you know you got a billion
People doing some wonderful things
People doing some powerful things
Let's change and do some powerful things
Unity could be a wonderful thing

[Hook]
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
(One for all, one for all)
(It's all it's all for one)
Let's start a union, calling every human
It's one for all and all for one
Let's live in unison, calling every citizen
It's one for all and all for one

I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me Baby like tryin' on clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat

[Bridge]
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Everything is gold, everything is equal
Posted on the porch just chillin', me and my people
Eyelids closed, gold sun shines on
The world’s coated in the gold Krylon, yay
And these days, days days, they never run away
Gold tints, shades, that block out that golden haze
Take all the gold from the pawnshop that lives behind the case
And g-g-give it away
When gold erupted from volcanoes in the heavens
And every shrine that existed in time melted
Tombs open, Dookie Ropes on the pharaohs
When everything is gold, who cares about the carats?
They say that gold's the skin of the gods
You can’t take the band-aid when you’re gone
Now I, now I-I-I, I’ll tip over that kiosk in the mall
As the sunset falls into tomorrow

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
Today we’re feeling like gold
So fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Alright now, we open up
That car door, hop out, hope they notice us
Throughout society we been locked in that cobra clutch
More gold bottles, gold bottles, never sober up
Ditch Jesus, In Gold I Trust
I solemnly swear to wear my cross and stunt
Separate myself by stickin' out just because
That’s how you illustrate power and who you’re above
But nah, tonight we take it, take it, giving it back
Crack open the vault, let everyone mob in the bank
Take whatever they want, we party and give thanks
I've been rocking gold chains since P was in the tank
You only live once, you only live once
Watch Rick Ross give his Jesus piece to a bum
'Cause tonight, we ball, we ball, we comin’ up
Paintin' the globe gold, two steppin’ on the sun like

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Today we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Gold coins, gold phone, gold car
Costs at least 10 racks to get 16 gold bars
Gold rush, suck on my gold dust stuntin'
Under these gold trunks, that’s 2 golden nugget
Flyin' on the gold eagle, flier than the rest of ‘em
Past the Space Needle, golden shower on pedestrians
Excuse me, that’s my bad, that’s my eagle and he shouldn’t have
My eagle got hair, that motherfucker got a mullet bruh
And it’s gold, two girls gold brass
Loungin' on the water, feet in the gold sand
Sippin' on Orangina, arms around them both pants
They’re sippin' Olde English right out of a gold can
Two girls, gold spandex so pretty
That girl ain’t even gold, she just got golden girl titties
I’m kidding, everyone is gold in my city
You paint Betty White gold, even Betty White can get it
Get it, get it, get it...

[Hook: Eighty4 Fly]
Today we're feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold, five hundred thousand sold
Slick Rick Gold, rope on, hella cold
And we stay fresh, so fresh head to toes
Goldschlager faded, 14 carat plated
So we’re feeling like gold
Oh, oh, oh, oh
So we’re feeling like gold

I'm tired of tending to this fire
I've used up all I've collected
I have singed my hands
It's glowing, embers barely showing
Proof of life in the shadows
Dancing on my plans

[Chorus]
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over

[Verse 2]
The burning is so low it's concerning
'Cause they know that when it goes out
It's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me
Why no one ever comes back
With details from beyond

They know that it's almost
They know that it's almost over
They know that it's almost

Last year I needed change of pace
Couldn't take the pace of change
Moving hastily
But this year, though I'm far from home
In Trench I'm not alone
These faces facin' me

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burnin', I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace!
Hope it ain't, Here we go, yo!
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low-end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No (*slurp*) you don't (*slurp*) under— (*slurp*) —stand (*slurp*)
I (*slurp*) don't (*slurp*) do this for (*hic*) anyone (*hic*) ever (*slurp*).
Yeah, that ain't what they all say?
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé
Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—

[Bridge: Wayne Fontana]
Game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her, Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!
And I told her, Go where you wanna!
Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch, I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick.
Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me – fuck you think, we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day. (*Phone hangs up*) Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin', I hope she's good enough
Meanwhile you're chasin' her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—

And I told her, Go where you wanna!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed – directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab.
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, Hit the road, then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', Rape!
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You're late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, dinner at eight? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—

I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, No
You can't marry my daughter

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 2]
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

[Verse 3]
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

[Chorus]
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one

Oh, how was I to know? I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Verse 2]
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I–

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

[Chorus]
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Knew we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
(Again!)

[Chorus]
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing (oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing)

[Intro: Macklemore]
1, 2, now

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Those three-plus years, I was so proud of
Then I threw them all away for two Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that He lied to me
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fucking privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
A 08/10/08 that now has been changed
And everyone that put me in some box as a saint
That I never was, just a false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I've written has all been fake?
Or will I just take my slip to the grave?
What the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know, what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look at him directly into his face
Deceit on your shoulders, deceivingly heavy weight
Haven't seen tears like this on my girl in a while
The trust that I once built has been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth and be judged for my mistakes
Than falsely held up, given props, loved and praised
I guess, I gotta get this on the page
Feeling sick and helpless
Lost the compass where self is
I know what I've gotta do, and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em, yeah
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I've gotta find a way to tell them

[Hook: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you’d gone, but you were with me all along, along

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober, I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the East Side, shaking, tweaking
Hope that they don't see it, hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Just posted in the back with my hands crossed, shooken
If they call on me I'm passin', if they talk to me I'm booking
Out that door, but before, I can make it
Somebody stops me and says Are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time, I just wanted to say that
If it wasn't for 'Otherside,' I wouldn't have made it
I just looked down at the ground and say, Thank you
She tells me she has nine months, and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry, fuck
I barely got forty-eight hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I want to tell her I relapsed, but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her, Congrats
Get back to my car, and I think I'm tripping, yeah
Cause God wrote Otherside, that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man, I fucked up
Like so many others, I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself didn't turn out that good

[Bridge: Macklemore]
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over

[Hook: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I thought you’d gone, but you were with me all along, along

[Outro: Ben Bridwell]
We fall, so hard, now we gotta get back what we lost, lost

<TITLE>Headlights</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Produced by Emile Haynie & Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
Cleanin' Out My Closet and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, Little prick, just leave!
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for Cleanin' Out My Closet
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life

<TITLE>Save Myself</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 2]
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

[Verse 3]
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself

<TITLE>this is why we can't have nice things</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(He didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

<BODY>
[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, tryin' to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings! I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you – aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's
Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit
And whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battle, sucka-duck, crawl out the back!
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, That's sharp
How much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo.
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
‘Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom! (Rape your mother!) – Tihs! (Kill your parents!)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', Fuck! Shit! Fuck!, adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'.
From the first album even the gals were like, Tight lyrics!
Dreamy eyes!, but my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and
Skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
Ha-ha! Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies

[Hook: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9]
There's darkness closing in (Evil twin), there it goes again (My evil twin)
It controls my pen (My evil twin), but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend (Evil twin), who pops up now and again (Evil twin)
So don't blame me (Evil twin), just blame him, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)

[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So, who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina!
I ain't fuckin' with either, Jessica neither:
Simpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible, read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off, tryin' to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden, it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryin' to get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin' Fuck the police! like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot! Look who's back
With a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez, it just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap – O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho
(Hey-ho!) I sound like I'm tryin' to sing
The fuckin' chorus to Hip Hop Hooray? No
I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman, try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘Cause we are the same, bitch!

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new

So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

Call it what you want, yeah

<BODY>
[Intro: Macklemore]
And we drink and get older
And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
We're city kids
You get what you ask for

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

[Hook: Choir]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer
At least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days
I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on
Close the chapter
Live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes
But those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality
Rarely lit
Memories, a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors
Graffiti and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain
Some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again
I guess it's relative
The Camel Lights
The whiskey, ryes
Sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second wind
Grow a moustache
Pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

[Hook: Choir]
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
So here's to the nights
Dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Poor out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real
Even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while
Just to say I visit

[Bridge: Macklemore]
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And acquaintances turn to friends
I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

<TITLE>Don't Front</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Verse 1]
Used to get bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spittin' like vintage Pac
Demented, demonic, sinister
Ever since the Doc' replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shockin' image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
‘Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxin' critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at
This and put emphasis on the dope
So when names come up, in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere
When it fires and I unload, my pen explodes
'Til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every 60 seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Beggin' my mom for K-Mart MacGregors
‘Cause they were new, St. Vincent de Paul
Those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adiós, I did it
They said I was a gimmick
Now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin' no argument
‘Cause you know I'll win it
Name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to Big Proof
You was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin' through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fuckin' tone that you speak
Feel like I'm in the zone, I'm in a whole different league
On my motherfuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete
And I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say Bon appétit!
‘Cause I don't know what to eat
Fuckin' microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown
‘Cause I rhyme like I'm still tryna get signed
Up in the Ebony Show-case
With Denaun screamin' Who the fuck passed you the mic?
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first
‘Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills crackin'
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down!
‘Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around, so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbin' it in and holdin' some grudge now? But don't front

[Hook: Buckshot]
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, word
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Yo, why you frontin'?
You know I got you open, kid

[Verse 3]
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers, ‘cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak, windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump in tonight
‘Cause I'm hyper or somethin'
Needin' someone or somethin' is lightin'
This fire under me, it's breathin' new life
It's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice, and it's funny
My days of being broke were so long ago
I lost all concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fuckin' nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm havin' a stroke of genius – Elizabeth, I'm comin' to you, honey
From boy to man
And still make a whore moan, like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man
Don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense
Precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers comin' up
That are nutty with the flow, but convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fuckin' mincin' of words
Without mincin' words that'll make you feel like I'm pinchin' a nerve
Who's mentally disturbed
You might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin bein' Indian burned
Hah, bitch, there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served, if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words

[Outro: Buckshot]
You know I got you open kid, stop frontin'
You know I got you open, Word Life...

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard, or it’s wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 1]
This is for the freaks and for my magicians
Booty clap and lap dancing technicians
Dance parties in the name of Great Britain
And American girls who love the Detroit Pistons
Like Dennis Rodman, I got a rod man (awww yeah!)
Long wong-dong in a soft hand
And a pink palm pink schlong, let's all dance!
From England to Stockholm
I'm wearing a cape just like a poncho
I got a cutey and I'm making a beat on her booty
Like I was at Bonnaroo beating up on a bongo
I got a bottle of Martinelli's and I'm dumping
All over anybody that's kicking it in the grotto
Neighbors keep tripping, I'm like, I'm in a castle
Fuck your condo!

[Bridge]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves

Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 2]
You like to party, I am a party-er
You like to wander, I am a wanderer
Your thighs are the closet to Narnia
Is it cool if I go and get lost in that?
I'm the lion, the witch in the wardrobe
Massage my lap, I have a sore bone
Of course cold on the dance floor
Like an Eskimo's toes in the North Pole
With both toes poking out of two holes
In the Eskimo socks, I'm hot
Like a cauldron from a warlock
Wearing sweatpants in a sauna
Who's your father? I'm not
I'm motherfuckin' Raven Bowie and here's my cock
Rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo sir
Take a hit of the hookah, now make it drop
Girl's booty was bigger than the stomach of Rick Ross'
Holy mother mountain of tender tendon to get lost in
Bounce, bounce, that castle booty, that bottom
Make it wobble, wobbly-wobble 'till my third leg has to hobble
You don't want to look back on this night
And think I should have been freaking on a booty
Freak-freaking on a booty

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Interlude]
This might be the best night that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had
That-that we have ever had together
Eh, motherfuckin' eh

[Bridge 2]
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of a party
In the night, in the middle of a party
Have you ever killed a coyote in the middle of the night
In the middle of a party
Brought it home and threw it on the carpet
Someone kill a coyote, I'm starving
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Who wants to eat a coyote?
Grab your bagpipe, I grab my flute
Cause drunk King John is still in the loo
Get onto the pole in a birthday suit, our suit
And M.J. was King, and Prince was Prince
And Raven has ruled ever since

[Hook]
Unicorns and wizard sleeves
Hammer pants and make believe
Pirate ships sailing off to sea
Will you come party with me in my
Castle, in my castle, in my castle, in my castle?

[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen, I'ma make you
Wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: Ouch! What the fuck you hit me for?!
Screamed life as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hoodie with a scythe, shit, I laughed in his face, spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like, Take this!
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch! Don't take shit
For granted, and don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more
Nothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'
You're at the la-bor-atory, stormin' like there's nothin' that's more important
Emcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?
I ain't finished, bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but—

[Hook]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane, breakbeats and words? An erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but you don't rap the same (Yeah!)
And you're lookin' way thinner 'cause your hunger got you lookin' like
They took away dinner (Chicka) Sugar Ray Leonard
Wouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a (chicka) what? (chicka) GOAT
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips, hope it lands on
Another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit anything of wit
That's interesting to spit, yo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand while extendin' the shit
How low can you go? Lower then Chuck D, ho
Hear the bassiness in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrians?
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots
To rap; I'm not a man, I'm a weapon who just happened
To be a rapper who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and a fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly
One, evilest bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-
-lite to people's like me havin' my teeth pulled

[Hook]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 3]
So step inside a dimension demented side of a mind that's like
An inside of an engine while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded: if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper you'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbin' the fences, lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes, edumacator (They are)
Shit, legends are made of, spit treacherous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam
Beatin' themselves in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head exam-ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan
I need meds, swear to God 'cause if I go off the edge
T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge, man
Heart-throb that’ll fart, ah, nah
More like a smart slob, part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Wal-
-Mart walls, little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'
There's nothing on this fuckin' Earth better than bein' the
King of the playground, I hate the swings, but I love bein'
An underdog 'cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)

[Hook]
Nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya
'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum
He'll fuckin' flip on ya

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I used to sit with my dad in the garage
That sawdust, that Pinesol, and the moss
Around every spring, when the winter thawed
We’d huddle around the radio, twist the broken knob
710 AM, no KJR. Dave Niehaus' voice would echo throughout the yard
Couldn’t have been older than 10
But to me and my friends
The voice on the other end might as well have been God’s
1995, the Division Series
Edgar's up to bat
Bottom of the 11th inning
Got the whole town listening
Swung on and belted, the words distorted. Joey Cora rounds third!
Here comes Griffey! The throw to the plate’s not in time!
My, oh my, the Mariners win it!
Yes. Fireworks, they lit up that ceiling in the Kingdome
We had just made history

[Interlude: Dave Niehaus]
Swung on and lined down the left field line for a base hit! Here comes Joey! Here comes Junior to third base! They’re gonna wave him in! The throw to the plate will be… late! The Mariners are going to play for the American League Championship! I don’t believe it! It just continues! My, oh my!

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Laces woven, barely holdin’ that stitch
The creases of time amongst the grime and the grit
Where the leather he used to pound his fists
To some it's just a mitt, but see that glove was him
Yep, tell me stories on the field, with that sun-stained brim
Blood under my chin, he taught me how to spit
Sunflower seeds back with me and my crew
Sunburnt arms
Big League Chew
Yeah we were like, The Sandlot after dinner
After practice we'd listen
To the M’s in the kitchen
And if mom wasn’t trippin’
Come on dad! Please, I swear, just one more inning!
Voice went pump, pump! through the system
Break out the rye bread! It's grand salami time!
My, oh my! Another victory!
Yes. My city, my city
Childhood, my life watchin’ Griffey right under those lights

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Under that light rain, gleaming in that night game, can't stop now
Keep moving, no brake pads!
Came here to prove a point, live my life on the field
Make history in between the base paths
And compete against the fear that is in me that’s my only barrier and I swear that I'mma break that!
From the mud
The cleats that we drug
Through the feet
This is that moment, and you can't take it back
I don’t really collect cards anymore, just a box and some old cardboard
Memories embedded in the dust, in the fibres that age just like us
Livin’ somewhere off in the drawer
This is what you make of it. Yeah, we play to win
Live it like we’re under the lights of the stadium
Fight until the day that God decides to wave us in
Right, until he waves us in
It’s my city, my city, childhood, my life. That’s right
Under those lights
My city, my city, childhood, that’s right. Niehaus, My, oh my!
Come on. My city, my city, childhood, my life. That’s right, under those lights
It's my city, my city, childhood, my life, Niehaus. My, oh my. Rest in peace

<BODY>
[Verse 1: Eminem ]
Girl, you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
Uhh, my mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a Roethlissplurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date 'cause I think I gave you power
When I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man, we jumped in too fast
'Cause since then I just can't be apart from her
'Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust it and she loves me 'cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and (Eminem)]
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
(What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right
Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight
'Cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

[Verse 2: Eminem ]
You were obviously oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from
The beginning, now I'm in disbelief, I
Never knew that this could be such misery, ah
'Cause now you see nothing but me
And I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are – super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on
Scared to be alone, can't specifically describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason
That's definitive, just need ya
Talkin' about I live and breathe ya
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch, put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
'Cause this ain't love

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and (Eminem)]
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
(What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right
Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight
'Cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

[Verse 3: Eminem ]
Just want you to myself
Don't wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whisperin' for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a
Little more mentally to get the picture.
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib ever again, no reason
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut
Guess what? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were usin' me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood
I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said, The fuck with that!
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?
She grabbed that fuckin' bat
And swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
Right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal
Through the uprights

[Hook: Jamie N Commons and (Eminem)]
You know this ain't love, oh no
You know this ain't love, oh no
(What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right
Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight
'Cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)

[Intro: Macklemore]
Now they say, Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And I was like Fuck that, humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty, just hopin' that I could find a bum
To buy a 40 for me and have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sippin' on some lean I would let loose
Lookin' in the mirror, watchin' myself lose
Cleaned up in oh-eight, got a job makin' barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with R.L., performing in front of eight people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
Now watching my pops in the back row grinnin'
With his glass up to my mom, toastin' his Guinness

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And we on, we on
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
One day we'll leave here
But these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yeah, nah, I won't win it yet, I probably won't get it, but
I'ma give it everything, play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all, everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control, and my soul's mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city, Seattle, that raised me
Rule four-thousand-and-eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Outro: Macklemore]
Oh my God
Feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit

[Interlude: Macklemore]
Now they say, Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first

[Outro: Macklemore]
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis
Put 'em up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up (so high)

<TITLE>Groundhog Day</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro]
What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare.

[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'Til one day I grew suspicious
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start anew, but ditchin'
Missouri for Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone, put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitchin’, her rules are Krypton-ite
So the walls, I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, runnin' through the kitchen
Pretendin' to be blind Superman, 'cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid
Disappear out of sight like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different
Music into the picture, and it became my new religion

[Interlude]
I remember it clearly, even today.

[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itchin' for somethin' to do, was flippin'
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixin'
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to The Wizard
You ain't have a fuckin' clue what you was missin'
I'd zone out with my headphones
All I remember doing's wishin' for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas, bitch!
It's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J coolin' system
Made that final manoeuvre to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this
That's how I knew my mission
Little boom box boomin', spittin'
Practicin' numerous writtens
When I'd sit in my room, envisionin' my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed
To do this shit; never quit, too persistent

[Interlude]
Carved an underground empire.

[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin' this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin'
You, and you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin' again
It tried ding-dong ditchin' shit, I fuckin' got that bitch in
A headlock, cut off its oxygen, Slim
Is not budgin' like cocksuckin' cinder blocks in the wind
Now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, koppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin', leg up on the competition
Promisin' complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em
Stompin' 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle, bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words
Is loose, but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts – shit, no wonder you're sore losers!
Now where's your poo, birds?
Ooh, no more trippin' in bird shit
Songs of self-empowerment surgin'
Words of encouragement, but discouragin'
The rappers, the rap game's god
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
Since yours ain't workin' out, each verse is
More merciless than the first is
And you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
To get served, bloodthirst revenge of the nerds, chka

[Interlude]
That you'll not escape my vengeance.

[Verse 4]
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin' into a non-humble Don
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row, get launched
Show you I'm bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo
On the fuckin' Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin' yawn
So mow the fuckin' lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fuckin' up this whole landscape of rap
The G.O.A.T. just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path
And take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke-cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
Charred debris floatin' like Oakwood
Was burnin', return of the no good and I won't quit

[Interlude]
And the next thing I know
Something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a blamed...

[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change
It's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around, y'all, 'cause you may
See if I popped your head

[Bridge]
I'm a monster, mutt
I'ma turn into a monster
I'm a monster, mutt
With my dick in your mouth all day!

[Outro]
I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing.

<TITLE>Beautiful Pain</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the
Mourning process, and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it
And poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past standing at inferno and chant

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died ‘cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down
‘Cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief it's like watching the walls
Melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

<TITLE>Wicked Ways</TITLE>
<BODY>
[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground, still can’t tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin' I'm proud to shop at K-Mart, and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin', I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I’m sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time, I'm gettin'—

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake, but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes – dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell

[Outro/Skit: Eminem & Ken Kaniff]
Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit… Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M.
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!
Blow it out your ass!
